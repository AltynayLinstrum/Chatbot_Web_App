<h3>AI Chatbot Web App</h3>
<p>I created this AI app with the help of Youtube tutorials, ChapGPT, online resources, and valuable insights of more experienced friends! It is a web application that allows users to communicate with a chatbot. The chatbot is designed to answer common questions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as symptoms, prevention measures, and vaccination information. Users can interact with the chatbot by typing messages in a chat interface.</p>
<h3>Technologies/Libraries Used</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Flask web framework</li>
  <li>ChatterBot library for generating responses to user queries</li>
  <li>HTML for creating the structure of the web pages</li>
  <li>CSS for styling the web pages</li>
  <li>JavaScript for creating dynamic elements and interactions</li>
 </ul><h3>Future Improvements</h3>
<p>There are several potential improvements that could be made to the Chatbot_Web_App in future iterations. For example, the chatbot could be trained on a larger dataset to improve the accuracy of its responses. Additionally, the user interface could be enhanced with additional features such as voice recognition and integration with other messaging platforms.</p>
